## What is Docker?

<u>**Docker**</u> is like a **box** that contains your app and everything it needs to run. no matter where you run it, it just works.

<br/>

Okay that might sound like a lot at first so before we jump into docker itself, let's first understand <u>**Why docker was
created?**</u> in the first place. It all started with one frustating issue every developer has faced.

> **“It works on my machine.”**

You’ve built a cool app. It runs fine on your system. You share the code with a friend,
**Boom. It breaks.** 
Missing dependencies, wrong versions, weird OS bugs.

<br />

This is the problem docker was designed to solve.


### ☁️ Real-World Example

Let’s say you’ve built a backend app using **Python** and **Flask**.

You’ve installed Python and Flask on your machine, and everything works perfectly.

But now, you share your app with a friend… and they can’t run it. Why?
<br />
- They don’t have Python installed.
- They’re using a different OS (maybe Linux, maybe BSD).
- Maybe their Python version is outdated.

So what now? Do they have to install Python, install Flask, set everything up exactly like you did?

That’s painful.

### 🐋 Docker Solution

Instead of making your friend install all the dependencies manually, you can just send them a **Docker image** and that contains your app **plus everything it needs to run**. 

They just run:
```bash
docker run your-app
```
And it works regardless of their OS, system setup or environment.

### 📦 How Docker Works?

![DockerArchitecture](https://www.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/docker-containerized-appliction-blue-border_2.png)

Docker runs on top of your host machine and uses **Linux containers** to run your apps.
It uses host machine(aka your operating system) **kernel** and a **layered file system** to store your apps and their
dependencies containerized.

In the next post, we'll build our first Docker container from scratch. See you then! 👋
